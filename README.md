🧩 How It Works
User logs in and sets up emergency contacts.

User starts a trip or moves around — trip details and live location are shared if needed.

Guardian AI monitors messages for keywords silently.

If SOS is triggered:

Emergency contacts receive live location and alert notifications.

Live video streaming can be started for real-time visibility.
